# LEARNING DJANGO

Exploring new territories on web development, this framework cought my eye.
Following a tutorial, I made a simple fruit store using this and Bootstrap.

# What does this project do?

Right now, it's only to show the basics of django. My very first project, very very simple.
It's a basic shop where you can buy fruits, and pretty much that's it. Of course, no cart is included so far, but eventually it will have it.

# Challenges

Being the first project, was pretty easy. I had to deal with some errors caused for using a different version of django than the tutorial followed, but solved quickly with a google search.
I thought it would be much longer and with more content, but that's it for now.
I'll start a new project soon with other tutorial, a little bit more complex.
After this, I'll do a full project for my own, or maybe for someone else. We'll see!
